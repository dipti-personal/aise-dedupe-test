  <h1>Page B — AI Agents (Engineering Perspective)</h1>

  <p>From an engineering standpoint, AI agents must be reliable, observable, and controllable. 
  Production agents require logging, versioning, and rollback capabilities to ensure safe operation.</p>

  <p>Key challenges include preventing infinite loops, controlling API costs, and ensuring that memory systems 
  do not introduce stale or conflicting information.</p>

  <p>This page intentionally contains different wording than Page A so deduplication systems can 
  distinguish between similar topics with different content.</p>
